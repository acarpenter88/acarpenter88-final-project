Final Project for CSET3100

I wanted to keep my final project fairly simple so I kept most of the programming concepts that we have already discussed in the class. I added some content to make the site feel more full and personal. I also added some additional navigation links to the navbar, as well as a floating "Back to top" button since the site is fairly long now. Otherwise I kept the overall look at feel as I like its simplicity.
